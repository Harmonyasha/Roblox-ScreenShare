## Setup

Change inside the script named ["main.py"](https://github.com/Dev0xz02/Owls-ScreenShare/blob/main/main.py) line 34,
you must replace "YourNgrokToken" with your ngrok token. You can get your ngrok's token [right here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup).

You can remove domain (domain variable), but if you wanna keep it = create your domain and replace "Create domain if you want" with your domain.
[Right here you can create your domain.](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains)

## How to setup your ngrok account.

Create your account [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
After you register your account, verify it by viewing ur email.

Now, download ngrok right [here](https://ngrok.com/download),
create folder in %temp% with name "ngrok" and put ngrok inside. 

NGROK's name should be: "ngrok.exe", otherwise the script would not work.

## Running the script.
Execute require in developer console or in serverside executor.
```lua
require(11643001589)("RobloxUserName","NgrokUrl")
```
